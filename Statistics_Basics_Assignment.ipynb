        "\n",
        "1.Discrete Random Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: A discrete random variable can take only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. These values are usually integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristic: The possible values can be listed out, and there are gaps between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of heads in 5 coin flips (values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of cars passing a toll booth in an hour (values: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability Distribution: The probability mass function (PMF) gives the probability of each possible value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Continuous Random Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: A continuous random variable can take an infinite number of values within a given range. The values are not countable, and they can be measured rather than counted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristic: There are no gaps between the possible values, and the variable can take any value within an interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "The height of a person (can be any value, like 5.4, 5.45, 5.445, etc.).\n",

        "The time it takes to run a race (could be 12.34 seconds, 12.345, etc.).\n",

        "1.Nature of Values:\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete random variables take countable, distinct values. These values are often integers. For example, the number of students in a class or the number of heads when flipping a coin multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous random variables, on the other hand, can take any value within a given range and are uncountable. These values are real numbers, and there are no gaps between them. Examples include height, weight, or time.\n",

        "\n",
        "Discrete: The number of books on a shelf (can be 1, 2, 3, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous: The time it takes for a person to run a race (could be any value like 12.45 seconds, 12.456 seconds, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Probability Distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "For discrete random variables, the probability mass function (PMF) is used, which gives the probability of each possible value.\n",
        "\n",
        "For continuous random variables, the probability density function (PDF) is used. Here, the probability of a specific value is technically zero, and probabilities are defined over ranges (intervals).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Probability of Exact Value:\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete random variables can have a non-zero probability for specific values. For example, you could calculate the probability of rolling a 3 on a die (1/6).\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous random variables have an infinitesimally small probability for any exact value. Since the range is infinite, the probability of any specific value is considered zero. Probability is instead calculated over intervals (e.g., the probability that a person's height is between 5'5\" and 5'7\").\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Possible Outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete variables have a finite or countably infinite number of possible outcomes. You can list all possible outcomes (e.g., the number of students can be 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on).\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous variables have an infinite number of outcomes within any given range, and these values can take on any value within that interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Measurement vs. Counting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete random variables are typically associated with counting (e.g., the number of cars in a parking lot).\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuous random variables are typically associated with measurement (e.g., measuring the time it takes to finish a task or the weight of an object)."
